TOEFL ITP tests are paper-based and use academic content to evaluate the English-language 
proficiency of non-native English speakers. The tests use new and previously administered 
TOEFL test questions and are used for placement, progress, evaluation, 
exit testing and other situations. The test scores, format and content of the test 
matches the "TOEFL PBT",[16] with the exception of not including the 
TWE (Test of Written Expression).

Unlike the TOEFL iBT and PBT tests, TOEFL ITP tests are administered by the institution and 
for internal use. It should not replace the need for the TOEFL iBT test, which is administered 
securely and includes Speaking and Writing components. 
There are two levels of TOEFL ITP: Level 1 (intermediate to advanced) and 
Level 2 (high beginning to intermediate).TOEFL ITP scores are mapped to the 
CEFR and test takers are provided with a certificate of achievement.
