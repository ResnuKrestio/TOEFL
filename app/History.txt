In 1962, a national council made up of representatives of thirty government and private organizations
was formed to address the problem of ensuring English language proficiency 
for non-native speakers wishing to study at U.S. universities.

This council recommended the development and administration of the TOEFL exam
for the 1963-1964 time frame.

The test was originally developed at the Center for Applied Linguistics under 
the direction of Stanford University applied linguistics professor Dr. Charles A. Ferguson.

The TOEFL test was first administered in 1964 by the Modern Language Association financed 
by grants from the Ford Foundation and Danforth Foundation.

In 1965, The College Board and ETS jointly assumed responsibility for the continuation of the 
TOEFL testing program.

In 1973, a cooperative arrangement was made between ETS, The College Board, 
and the Graduate Record Examinations board of advisers to oversee and run the program. 
ETS was to administer the exam with the guidance of the TOEFL board.

To the present day, college admission criteria for international students who are 
Commonwealth of Nations nationals are exempted from taking the TOEFL exam - nations 
which are part of the Anglosphere (from Commonwealth realms to former British colonies e.g. 

Hong Kong SAR or former protectorates of the United States) where 
English is the de facto official language automatically grants a TOEFL exemption 
with some restrictions (e.g. residents of Quebec are required to take TOEFL 
while the rest of Canada is exempt - also inclusive of Commonwealth nations where 
English is not an official language e.g. 

Mozambique or Namibia (English is co-official but spoken by 3% of the population).
